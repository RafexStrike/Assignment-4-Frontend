Design System Context: My project uses a deep "Midnight/Dark Blue" theme. Here are the core tokens:

Backgrounds: Primary: #0a0e1a, Secondary: #0f1525.

Primary Brand: #0057e6 (Blue-600) with Cyan accents.

Typography: "Bricolage Grotesque" for headings, "Inter" for body.

Effects: Extensive use of backdrop-blur-xl, border transparency (border-slate-800/50), and blue-600 glow shadows.

Styling Rules:

Use Tailwind CSS.

For dark backgrounds, use bg-[#0a0e1a] or bg-slate-950.

For cards, use bg-slate-900/50 backdrop-blur-sm border border-slate-800/50.

Use Lucide React for icons.

Implement "Glow" effects on buttons and inputs using gradients.
